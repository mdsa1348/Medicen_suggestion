Fractures are different from other injuries to the skeleton such as dislocations, although in some cases it can be hard to tell them apart. Sometimes, a person may have more than one type of injury. If in doubt,treat the injury as if it is a fracture.
The symptoms of a fracture depend on the particular bone and the severity of the injury, but may include:

1.Pain
2.Swelling
3.Bruising
4.Deformity
5.Inability to use the limb.
=========================
Good first-aid care of fractures is always important. Moving the broken bones can increase pain and bleeding and can damage tissues around the injury. This can lead to complications in the repair and healing of the injury later on.
First aid for fractures is all about immobilising (limiting movement of) the injured area. Splints can be used for this. Control any external bleeding. Complicated breaks where a limb is very deformed may need to be realigned before splinting – only paramedics or medical staff should do this.
Fractures of the head or body such as skull, ribs and pelvis are all serious and should be managed by paramedics.

If you suspect a bone fracture, you should:

1.Keep the person still – do not move them unless there is an immediate danger, especially if you suspect fracture of the skull, spine, ribs, pelvis or upper leg
2.Attend to any bleeding wounds first. Stop the bleeding by pressing firmly on the site with a clean dressing. If a bone is protruding, apply pressure around the edges of the wound
3.If bleeding is controlled, keep the wound covered with a clean dressing
4.Never try to straighten broken bones
5.For a limb fracture, provide support and comfort such as a pillow under the lower leg or forearm. However, do not cause further pain or unnecessary movement of the broken bone
6.Apply a splint to support the limb. Splints do not have to be professionally manufactured. Items like wooden boards and folded magazines can work for some fractures. You should immobilise the limb above and below the fracture
7.Use a sling to support an arm or collarbone fracture
8.Raise the fractured area if possible and apply a cold pack to reduce swelling and pain
9.Stop the person from eating or drinking anything until they are seen by a doctor, in case they will need surgery

In an emergency, call triple zero (000) for an ambulance.
===================================
Doctors can diagnose bone fractures with x-rays. They may also use CT scans (computed tomography) and MRI scans (magnetic resonance imaging).

Broken bones heal by themselves – the aim of medical treatment is to make sure the pieces of bone are lined up correctly. The bone needs to recover fully in strength, movement and sensitivity. Some complicated fractures may need surgery or surgical traction (or both).

Depending on where the fracture is and how severe, treatment may include:

1.Splints - to stop movement of the broken limb
2.Braces - to support the bone
3.Plaster cast - to provide support and immobilise the bone
4.Traction - a less common option
5.Surgically inserted metal rods or plates - to hold the bone pieces together
6.Pain relief.
===========================
Follow your doctor's advice, but general suggestions include:

1.Until the cast has set properly, avoid direct heat such as hot water bottles.
2.Rest the limb as much as possible.
3.Use the techniques shown to you by nurses to walk or manage day-to-day activities. For example, you risk further injury if you use crutches incorrectly.
4.Avoid any lifting or driving until the fracture has healed.
5.If the skin under the cast is itchy, don’t poke anything between the cast and your limb (such as a coat hanger or pencil). Instead, use a hairdryer to blow cool air into the cast.
6.Don’t get your cast wet, as wet plaster becomes soft and does not provide the necessary support. Wet plaster can also irritate your skin. When showering, wrap the cast in a plastic bag and tape it directly to your skin, to keep the area watertight.
7.Meet your doctor immediately if you have swelling, blueness or loss of movement of the fingers or toes, pins and needles, numbness or increased pain.
